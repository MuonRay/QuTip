# QuTip
a collection of codes for use in simulating quantum systems, with particular attention of generating Wigner function, Density matrix and other plots to monitor the number of states as they grow in complexity and evolve over time. Of particular interest is to model many-body networks as a cavity with a designated input and output class node(s).
